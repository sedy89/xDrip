### Documentation regarding the KEKS plugin produced by JamOrHam

To support newer Dex ONE transmitters an additional plugin is required: 

This plugin is called KEKS and has been developed by JamOrHam who is the xDrip+ lead developer. 

When needed, the plugin is automatically downloaded and utilized after user confirmation. 

Development of this plugin was commercially funded and the plan is to release it open-source in due course, but this is still an active work in progress and currently it is only available in a pre-compiled form.

For the benefit of xDrip+ users, to make use of these transmitters, it has been released now.

#### FAQ:

> Can I use this free of charge?

*Yes, the software is provided free "AS IS" for you to use without restriction.*

> Can I use this in my own fork or software?

*Yes, this is fine. For custom software you would be advised to contact JamOrHam to ensure best practices are followed.*

> How do I know the plugin that is downloaded is exactly the same one JamOrHam published?

*The plugin file is digitally signed ensuring security while being stored and transmitted and that it is exactly the same as when published and that the author is JamOrHam.*

> What if I don't want to use the plugin?
